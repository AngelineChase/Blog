<h1 class="title">WELCOME TO YOUR GLOW UP JOURNEY</h1>
<h5 class="undertitlefirst">Added by Costaș Anghelina on April 18, 2025</h5>
<p class="description"> Welcome to Glow Up Journey – a space where self-discovery, style, study, and psychology come together to help young women become the best version of themselves.<br>

    This website was created as part of my participation in <a href="https://adfaber.org/en/breaking-barriers/" target="_blank">The Girls Code – Breaking Barriers</a>, a powerful initiative launched by <a href="https://adfaber.org" target="_blank">Adfaber.org</a>, dedicated to encouraging and supporting young talents in the fields of technology and entrepreneurship.
    
       Through this course, I was introduced to the world of HTML&CSS.<br>
        At first, it felt like learning a completely new language. But as the lessons progressed, I began to see coding as more than just technical work—it became a tool of creativity, self-expression, and independence.<br></p>


    <h2 class="stitle"> Glow Up Journey reflects my personal passions:<br></h2>

    <p class="description">FASHION - as forms of confidence and identity; <br>
     PSYCHOLOGY - to better understand and heal ourselves;   <br>
     BOOKS -  to build inner strength and resilience through words.<br> </p>

     <p class="description">This course taught me more than web design—it helped me believe in my ability to create, to lead, and to innovate. It reminded me that girls truly do belong in tech, and that we have the power to break barriers and build our own paths.<br>
    Thank you, <a href="https://adfaber.org" target="_blank">Adfaber.org</a>, for opening this door and showing us that the future can be shaped by those brave enough to build it.</p>
